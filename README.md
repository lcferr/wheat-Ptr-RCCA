# wheat-Ptr-RCCA

This repository contains the data and R scripts for performing Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RCCA) on wheat transcriptomics (DEGs) and metabolomics (DAMs) datasets. The analysis focuses on two wheat genotypes, Hereward (Her) and Robigus (Rob), in response to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) infection.
